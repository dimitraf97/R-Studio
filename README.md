NLP Text Analysis on R
This project applies key NLP techniques in R using the book "Madame Bovary" by Gustave Flaubert from Project Gutenberg (via the gutenbergr package). It includes:
  -Word and bi-gram frequency analysis
  -Chi-square tests for word dependence with visualizations
  -Entropy calculations and confidence intervals
  -Naive Bayes classification of text sections
